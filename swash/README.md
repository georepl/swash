# swash

The swash library analyzes and evaluates freehand symbols. It performs so called online pattern recognition, which means that it is not only based on the pattern itself but also on meta information, i.e. drawing velocity.
The library takes a two-dimensional shape in form of a list  ['(x1 x1 t1) '(x2 y2 t2) ... '(xn yn tn)], where xi and yi are the cartesian coordinates of the shape and ti a timestamp in milliseconds allowing for determinating the writing speed.
swash is written in Clojure.
